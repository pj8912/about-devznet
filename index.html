        <p><h2 id="why-devznet-"> 🤔 Why Devznet? </h2>
            <p>About <strong>60-70%</strong> of developer population are <strong>self-taught</strong>, who are good at building stuff and solving problems without
                traditional credentials but not so good at selling themselves. With the traditional system's requirement for academic credentials, millions of developers get overlooked. These things makes it hard for developers to create their own network,  distributed
                across many apps and websites to contribute value and feel a sense of community. </p>
                
                <h3 id="-devznet-">✨Devznet✨</h3>
                <p>
                <strong>Devznet</strong> is a platform that brings together a comphrensive range of features such as project
                showcases, job listings, Q&amp;A and more, creating a one-stop site for developers to create and connect
                with like minded people</p>

            <h2 id="q-a-why-"> 🙋‍♂️ Q&amp;A, why⁉️</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Stackover</strong> is <strong>toxic 🤢</strong> and ruled by mods, awarded for questions being
                        removed. Theses things makes hard to get started in the first place.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Quora</strong> is <strong>closed 🔒</strong> and not so developer centric.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Codegrepper</strong> messed up with their <strong>reward</strong> system giving us a
                        <strong>useless tokens 🪙🪙</strong> with which we can only buy <strong>NFT</strong> that we don&#39;t
                        even asked for.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We just want a simple Q&amp;A system where everyone can participate and feel a sense of community. I
                personally believe that positive interaction with people online can improve developers mental health.</p>
            <p>Afterall what is the point of a Q&amp;A site if you can&#39;t upvote a question without any credentials. Why
                someone has the power to delete my question?</p>
            <p>Don&#39;t believe me take a look at these videos </p></p>
    <p>Here in devznet everybody is allowed to ask questions, like question , post answe for a question . No one can delete the question other than the one who asked it.</p>
    We aim to foster a sense of community and support positive interactions among developers.
